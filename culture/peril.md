title: Artsy Engineering Automation via Peril
description: How do we take on our workflow in GitHub
---

Peril has been running in Artsy since mid 2017, the blog post which [covers what Peril is and why it was
created][blog] is useful reading for this document.

This document covers, at the highest level, what Peril does at Artsy. The real source of truth for these rules is
the [`peril.settings.json`][settings] in [`artsy/peril-settings`][repo].

### Peril Infra

Artsy uses [a fork][fork] of Peril. It currently runs in our staging Kubernetes environment.

### Workflow improvements

  [RFC #1095](https://github.com/artsy/reaction/issues/1095)

#### Issues

  [upcoming week](https://github.com/artsy/peril-settings/pull/46)

#### Deployments

- When any repo has a new tag created, a message goes to our
  [#deployments](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/CA3LTRT0T) slack channel

### Scheduled Jobs

We used to have Peril run scheduled tasks. Some of those have been migrated over to the Joule repositoryÂ and
[run as GitHub Actions](https://github.com/artsy/joule/actions).
