# Slack

Get on [Slack](https://artsy.slack.com) ðŸ”’. You can download the OS X app from the
[Mac App store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12). Also, install it on your phone. We use
Slack for all internal messaging, and prefer it to email in, basically, all cases.

### Engineering Slack Channels

You should always feel up to date on these two:

- [#dev](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev) ðŸ”’: Engineering-wide chat.
- [#dev-offtopic](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-offtopic) ðŸ”’: Engineers chatting about less timely and
  work-relevant topics.

There are a few other useful dev-related slacks:

- [#dev-help](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-help) ðŸ”’: Get help with any engineering-related questions.
- [#dev-banter](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-banter) ðŸ”’: For chatting with developers, not about work.

### Tips and Tricks

- Typing `@channel` in any channel will send a notification to everyone in that channel. Refrain from doing this
  unless itâ€™s imperative that everyone see your message. You can also `@` people directly in a channel, or
  direct-message them.

- If it's relevant to people in the room at the moment, use `@here`.

- Most sets of people are set up as a slack team, `@dev-leads`, `@engineering`, `@dteam` (design), `@mobile` and
  `@product-managers`. Feel free to make more.

- `/call` or `/hangout` will start a video chat in that channel.

- Slack uses markdown for styling text.

  - \`\`\``multi-line code`\`\`\`
  - \``single-line code`\`
  - \*_italic_\*
  - \*\***bold**\*\*
