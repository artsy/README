# Slack

Get on [Slack](https://artsy.slack.com). You can download the OS X app from the
[Apple store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12). Also, install it on your phone. We use
Slack for all internal messaging, and prefer it to email in, basically, all cases.

### Engineering Slack Channels

You should always feel up to date on these two:

- [#dev](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev): Engineering-wide chat.
- [#dev-offtopic](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-offtopic): Engineers chatting about less timely and
  work-relevant topics.

There are a few other useful dev-related slacks:

- [#dev-banter](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-banter): For chatting with developers, not about work.
- [#dev-candidates](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-candidates): If you want to be involved in hiring.

Engineering teams each maintain a dedicated channel (but all are welcome):

- Grow: [#product-grow](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/product-grow)
- Discover/Evaluate: [#product-discovaluate](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/product-discovaluate)
- Purchase: [#product-purchase](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/product-purchase)
- Sell: [#product-sell](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/product-sell)

### Tips and Tricks

- Typing `@channel` in any channel will send a notification to everyone in that channel. Refrain from doing this
  unless it’s imperative that everyone see your message. You can also `@` people directly in a channel, or
  direct-message them.

- If it's relevant to people in the room at the moment, use `@here`.

- Most sets of people are set up as a slack team, `@dev-leads`, `@engineering`, `@dteam` (design), `@mobile` and
  `@product-managers`. Feel free to make more.

- `/call` or `/hangout` will start a video chat in that channel.

- Slack uses markdown for styling text.

  - \`\`\``multi-line code`\`\`\`
  - \``single-line code`\`
  - \*_italic_\*
  - \*\***bold**\*\*

- Read this short article on
  [getting the most out of Slack](https://medium.com/@slackhq/11-useful-tips-for-getting-the-most-of-slack-5dfb3d1af77).

- Please don't swear.
