# Slack

Get on [Slack](https://artsy.slack.com) ðŸ”’. You can download the OS X app from the
[Mac App store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12). Also, install it on your phone. We use
Slack for all internal messaging, and prefer it to email.

### Engineering Slack Channels

You should always feel up to date on these two:

- [#dev](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev) ðŸ”’: Engineering-wide chat.
- [#dev-offtopic](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-offtopic) ðŸ”’: Engineers chatting about less timely and
  work-relevant topics.

There are a few other useful dev-related slacks:

- [#dev-help](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-help) ðŸ”’: Get help with any engineering-related questions.
- [#dev-banter](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-banter) ðŸ”’: For chatting with developers, not about work.

### Product teams

Each product team maintains a `#product-<name>` channel which is the primary location for discussion, sharing, and
decision-making. Join and monitor your team's. Join other teams' channels, too. The more the merrier.
- [#team-pdde](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/team-pdde) ðŸ”’: The whole product organization
- [#product-updates](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/product-updates) ðŸ”’: New features or releases

### Practices

Practices are informal groups of engineers working on similar problems.

- [#practice-web](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/practice-web) ðŸ”’
- [#practice-mobile](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/practice-mobile) ðŸ”’
- [#practice-platform](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/practice-platform) ðŸ”’

### Incident Handling

- [#alerts](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/alerts)ðŸ”’: automated system alerts
- [#incidents](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/alerts)ðŸ”’: Any incident-handling starts (as a thread) here.
- Dedicated channels are created to handle most incidents.

### Miscellaneous

### Tips

- _Thread_ related conversations to limit channel noise.
- Mentioning `@channel` will notify everyone in the channel. Mentioning `@here` will notify those currently active
  in the channel. Use both with caution.
