# Show & Tell

In order to better know what our teammates are up to, every other week we set
aside an hour and in an open mic-style setting show each other what we're
working on. These short talks/demos/code reviews are not meant to be polished
presentations, but instead impromptu ways we can share lessons learned and cool
things discovered!

This happens at the same time slot as [Lunch & Learn](lunch-and-learn.md) and we
alternate between the two events. On Lunch & Learn weeks without a speaker lined
up, we fall back to doing a bonus Show & Tell.

Previous demos include:

- Cool things with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) by [@anandaroop][roop].
- Initial work on the new [CocoaPods metadata service](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-metadata-service) by [@orta][orta].
- Experimenting with [Rails+React+TypeScript](https://github.com/jonallured/update_queue) with [@jonallured][jon].
- Preview of [Building Better Software by Building Better Teams](https://appdevcon.nl/session/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/) by [@ashfurrow][ash].
- Experimenting with [Isomorphic Relay](https://github.com/damassi/isomorphic-relay-app) by [@damassi][chris].
