# Show & Tell

Show & Tell is a new, **optional** weekly event we're trying out to get more visibility into what our teammates
have been working on recently. It is scheduled weekly for a half hour each week (see the shared Engineering Open
Meetings calendar) and consists of three ten-minute walkthroughs. These walkthroughs are a presentation of
works-in-progress and _no_ preparation is expected of these presenters. We get people excited about Show & Tell at
[Monday standups](open_standup.md) and then do an _@here_ an hour beforehand to remind people. We then meet and, in
an open mic-style, developers step forward to show and tell!

Previous demos include:

- Cool things with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) by [@anandaroop][roop].
- Initial work on the new [CocoaPods metadata service](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-metadata-service) by
  [@orta][orta].
- Experimenting with [Rails+React+TypeScript](https://github.com/jonallured/update_queue) with [@jonallured][jon].
- Preview of
  [Building Better Software by Building Better Teams](https://appdevcon.nl/session/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/)
  by [@ashfurrow][ash].
- Experimenting with [Isomorphic Relay](https://github.com/damassi/isomorphic-relay-app) by [@damassi][chris].

It's still early in the process so we're looking forward to how this event can grow and encourage cross-team
collaboration and knowledge sharing.
