title: Writing Office Hours
description: Weekly meeting for support sharing knowledge
---

Writing office hours are a weekly drop-in meeting run by [Ash][] every Monday at 2pm (NYC time) in the caf√© area on
the 24th floor, or over Slack. The purpose of Writing Office Hours was originally to help Artsy staff with
_writing_, specifically blog posts. Today, the office hours are for help with sharing knowledge _generally_ and not
just through writing.

Here are some examples of good uses of Writing Office Hours:

- You'd like to write a blog post but don't know where to start.
- There is a conference you're thinking of submitting to and want some feedback on your application.
- There's an important email you have to write.
- You're presenting a [Knowledge Share][ks] to the team and want to go through a dry run first.
- You will be a guest on a podcast and want to organize some thoughts first.
- You have _most_ of a blog post written out, but want help getting it over the finish line.
