# Demo Days at Artsy

Demo Days are a way of showing off shipped projects to the rest of the team. It's a collection of 4-6 projects,
explained by the people who contributed to them: product managers, designers and programmers.

There are three separate roles involved in pulling a demo day off:

- Slides / Project Coordinator
- MC
- Technical Support

Most of the work is done before-hand in preparing the deck, and deciding what to show. This is the role of the
slides/project coordinator. On the morning of a demo day, they need to:

- Start the process by going to the [Sprint Kickoff][kickoff] slides
- Make sure to find the sprint that’s just ending
- Get all the tech leads names
- Make a message to everyone asking for what they can do
- Something like: “@x, @y, @z - you were all tech leads on this sprint, @a, @b, @c product people, @d, @e, @f
  designers - the rest of the company uses demo days to see what the product team is up to, what did your team ship
  this sprint that's important to share?”
- Collect feedback on what we could do, poke people privately if you don't get responses
- Open the last demo day slides, and make a copy with a new date
- Make a [terrigood][ud] nickname for the demo
- Paste the link in Slack as you start to fill out who is speaking
- Get the projects decided, add them to the white overview slides
- Add a black slide for each person
- Add the projects to the wine section at the end

### 60m before

- Announce on slack that it’s happening

e.g.

- Buy wine for the winner

### 30m before

- Get a laptop from the side cupboard
- Find out who will need to log in to authenticated pages
- Take it round to them and help them get set up

### 15m before

- Ensure that the projector is set up
- Test all the mics
- Move the stand in front of projector

### 5m before

- Hit record button on zoom room
- send out an @here on general

## Running a demo day presentation

You need two people:

- An MC, who speaks and introduces projects
- A tech person, who tracks slack for technical issues ( volume, mics etc )
- And ideally someone else who can give away the wine at the end.

The presentation work is mostly handled by the MC

- The MC start by offering an explanation of what demo days are
- Then covers an overview of the major projects
- Introduces the speakers etc
- Helps out with tech support on stage
- Once all talks are done, then request the person who is giving out the wine to come on stage
- The tech person monitors #general and #demo-days for requests

### After

- Turn off the recording by finishing the zoom meeting
- Check you mail for the recording, it could take about an hour
- Put it in the Artsy Videos dropbox folder
- Send out another message (no @here though) with the video in #general
