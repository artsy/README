# Demo Days at Artsy

Demo Days are a celebration of the progress and wins accomplished by PDDE (Product-Design-Data-Engineering) members over the last month and an opportunity for cross-team knowledge share and discussion.

It is a time for us to share recent launches, work-in-progress (design, code), analysis (data, quantitative or qualitative research), look-backs on project performance, and future visioning. 

Please refer to the [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/artsy/PDDE-Demo-Days-99acffcefb534cd6a8db1b6d983930c7)🔒 for more details on how to sign up and how the event is organised.
