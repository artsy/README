# Lunch & Learn

When Artsy was under 50 people, we would hold "Brown Bag" meetings. These were talks on a variety of art+science
topics. As we out-grew the format, we started doing engineering "Brown Bag" meetings. Occasionally.

This worked for a while, but was sporadic and mostly the same speakers. Once we moved to
[a new stand-up format](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/03/23/artsy-technology-stack-2015/) it felt like time to
re-vamp our brown bags too.

Our format is pretty simple, every Thursday we have an hour slot at 12:30 (NYC time) on the calendar for someone to
give a talk or presentation. I think [Alan](http://twitter.com/alanjay1/) described it well on
[Professional Development at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/09/22/professional-development-at-artsy-engineering/):

> Every Thursday, we do a Lunch-and-Learn session. Historically, we mostly showed off tech we use internally. But
> over about a year, most of our tech stack has been presented this way, so we also bring in engineers we know at
> other companies to share what they’re working on.

You're probably seeing this as an external developer to Artsy, who has been invited to talk.

## Format

The format is definitely not set in stone, however these are what has worked for us internally and for past
contributors.

#### Presentation

Traditional conference/meetup style: You bring slides, we watch. You talk, we listen. You finish, we ask questions.

We don't expect conference/meetup-level presentation or practice. A lack of polish is okay. This is a great
opportunity to present new talks ideas.

#### Company Walkthrough

More informal, you can come with other speakers and talk about the ways in which your company works. Covering your
tech stack, the decisions behind them. With the presentation mainly being a series of demos, and showing code
architecture.

## Schedule

- Arrive at Artsy for 12:15am (we're [401 Broadway, 26th Floor, 10013][401] - Canal St is the closest station)
- Our receptionist on 26 will get in touch with whoever you've been in contact with, probably [Orta][] or [Ash][]
- They will get you set up on our 27th floor Classroom
- We will set up [a stream](#recording) for global developers and slides
- We have until 12:30 to get any technical difficulties sorted out ([the docs are here][trouble])
- You give a presentation (~30 minutes)
- We ask a bunch of questions (~15 minutes)
- Whoever helped get you set up takes you out for lunch on us

Artsy Engineering now owes you, and your company
[a talk back](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/teaching-and-learning-1). Feel free to arrange that whenever you
like.

## Recording

We ask that we can share a livestream of your talk, because we have a lot of
[global colleagues](https://www.artsy.net/article/eloy-duran-going-global-5-tips-to-make-remote-work). This
involves loading a [Zoom.us][] link on your computer and sharing your screen.

We also ask that we get a recording of the talk (kept internal within Artsy), for colleagues who couldn't attend or
want to review your awesome talk later. This is done through Zoom.us for you, not setup required. We'd like to get
a copy of your slides, too. Of course, we're happy to send you a copy of the recording.

**If you don't want to be recorded, no problem**. We understand that you might talk and show things that are not
for public consumption. We will not share anything externally without your express permission.
