# Knowledge Share

When Artsy was under 50 people, we would hold "Brown Bag" meetings. These were talks on a variety of art+science
topics. As we out-grew the format, we started doing engineering "Brown Bag" meetings. Occasionally.

This worked for a while, but was sporadic and mostly the same speakers. Once we moved to [a new stand-up
format][standup_post] it felt like time to re-vamp our brown bags too.

For a few years we ran a weekly "Lunch & Learn" on Thursdays to educate the team about our stack, business
proceses, recent projects, or other interesting technical topics. [Alan][alan] described it well on [Professional
Development at Artsy][alan_post]:

> Every Thursday, we do a Lunch-and-Learn session. Historically, we mostly showed off tech we use internally. But
> over about a year, most of our tech stack has been presented this way, so we also bring in engineers we know at
> other companies

After a while we decided to mix things up by:

- Inviting the occasional external speaker (see some examples below)
- Alternating formal, scheduled Lunch & Learns with informal, open-mic style [Show & Tells](show-and-tell.md)

As the team has grown and become more international (and no longer lunches around the same time), we've renamed
this event to Engineering Knowledge Share. We still aim to alternate between formal presentations, and informal
show-and-tells.

You may be seeing this as an external developer to Artsy, who has been invited to talk, or as an internal colleage
who's been asked to give a presentation.

## Format

The format is definitely not set in stone, however these are what has worked for us internally and for past
contributors.

### Presentation

Traditional conference/meetup style: You bring slides, we watch. You talk, we listen. You finish, we ask questions.

We don't expect conference/meetup-level presentation or practice. A lack of polish is okay. This is a great
opportunity to present new talks ideas.

### Company Walkthrough

More informal, you can come with other speakers and talk about the ways in which your company works. Covering your
tech stack, the decisions behind them. With the presentation mainly being a series of demos, and showing code
architecture.

## Recording

We ask that we can share a livestream of your talk, because we have a lot of [global colleagues][global_post]. This
involves loading a [Zoom.us][] link on your computer and sharing your screen.

[global_post]: https://www.artsy.net/article/eloy-duran-going-global-5-tips-to-make-remote-work
[zoom.us]: https://zoom.us

We also ask that we get a recording of the talk (kept internal within Artsy), for colleagues who couldn't attend or
want to review your awesome talk later. This is done through Zoom.us automatically, no additional setup is
required. We'd like to get a copy of your slides, too. Of course, we're happy to send you a copy of the recording.

**If you don't want to be recorded, no problem**. We understand that you might talk and show things that are not
for public consumption. We will not share anything externally without your express permission.
