# Knowledge Share

When Artsy was under 50 people, we would hold "Brown Bag" meetings. These were
talks on a variety of art+science topics. As we out-grew the format, we started
doing engineering "Brown Bag" meetings. Occasionally.

This worked for a while, but was sporadic and mostly the same speakers. Once we
moved to [a new stand-up format][standup_post] it felt like time to re-vamp our
brown bags too.

For a few years we ran a weekly "Lunch & Learn" on Thursdays to educate the team about our stack, business proceses, recent projects, or other interesting technical topics. [Alan][alan] described it well on [Professional Development at
Artsy][alan_post]:

> other companies


After a while we decided to mix things up by:

- Inviting the occasional external speaker (see some examples below)
- Alternating formal, scheduled Lunch & Learns with informal, open-mic style [Show & Tells](show-and-tell.md)

As the team has grown and become more international (and no longer lunches around the same time), we've renamed this event to Engineering Knowledge Share. We still aim to alternate between formal presentations, and informal show-and-tells.

You may be seeing this as an external developer to Artsy, who has been
invited to talk, or as an internal colleage who's been asked to give a presentation.

## Format

The format is definitely not set in stone, however these are what has worked for
us internally and for past contributors.

### Presentation

Traditional conference/meetup style: You bring slides, we watch. You talk, we
listen. You finish, we ask questions.

We don't expect conference/meetup-level presentation or practice. A lack of
polish is okay. This is a great opportunity to present new talks ideas.

### Company Walkthrough

More informal, you can come with other speakers and talk about the ways in which
your company works. Covering your tech stack, the decisions behind them. With
the presentation mainly being a series of demos, and showing code architecture.

## Recording

We ask that we can share a livestream of your talk, because we have a lot of
[global colleagues][global_post]. This involves loading a [Zoom.us][] link on
your computer and sharing your screen.

[global_post]: https://www.artsy.net/article/eloy-duran-going-global-5-tips-to-make-remote-work
[zoom.us]: https://zoom.us

We also ask that we get a recording of the talk (kept internal within Artsy),
for colleagues who couldn't attend or want to review your awesome talk later.
This is done through Zoom.us automatically, no additional setup is required.
We'd like to get a copy of your slides, too. Of course, we're happy to send you
a copy of the recording.

**If you don't want to be recorded, no problem**. We understand that you might
talk and show things that are not for public consumption. We will not share
anything externally without your express permission.
