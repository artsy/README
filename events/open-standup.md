# Engineering Standup at Artsy

We've been doing engineering stand-ups for as long as there has been an engineering team. The format has changed
over time as the size and scope of Artsy has changed. We're now on our fourth iteration of this process, which you
can [read more about here][standup_blog].

The current on-call engineers run standup. On-call rotations are staggered so an engineer starting on a Monday will
team up with the engineer that started the preceding Wednesday. **Pick one person to do the talking parts
(facilitate the meeting) and one person to take notes**.

### Ten minutes before a standup

The person handling the talking parts does this stuff ten minutes before standup:

- `@here`s the dev channel.
- Creates the new standup notes doc using the predefiend template in [Notion][].
- The meeting starts with props (as a nod towards [People are Paramount][pplp]) and you should begin with giving
  props of your own.

### During standup

The person who is facilitating the meeting follows the structure of the standup template in Notion.

## After standup

The link to the [Notion][] document is shared into #dev on Slack after standup.

Finally, **review this document** for ways to improve the instructions for next week's meeting.
