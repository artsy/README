## Request For Comments

A Request For Comments (or RFC) is how we change things, by opening a discussion that everyone can participate in and deciding if we want to move forward with the suggested change or not.

RFCs should be created by authoring a markdown file in the `/RFCs` folder and then opening a pull request. [Read the full playbook][rfc_playbook] for all the details!
