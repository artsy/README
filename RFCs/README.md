### How we handle RFCs at Artsy

RFCs are an important part of how we evolve as an engineering organisation. Any time someone wants to introduce a change to our existing processes, or concretely define a process that was previously unspoken, they create an RFC. This document is then discussed and a decision is reached on whether to accept or reject the proposal.
