### How we handle RFCs at Artsy

RFCs are an important part of how we evolve as an engineering organisation. Any time someone wants to introduce a
change to our existing processes, or concretely define a process that was previously unspoken, they create an RFC.

The RFC is a pull request that creates a new markdown document in this directory, describing the change or
definition. This document is then discussed within the PR and a decision is reached on whether to accept or reject
the proposal. If the proposal is accepted, the PR is merged, leaving us with a permanent record of the accepted
proposal.

These documents can of course be changed at a later date via a new RFC PR.

For a more detailed description of the process, take a look at our
[RFC Playbook](https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/main/playbooks/rfcs.md).
