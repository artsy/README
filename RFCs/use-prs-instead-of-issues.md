# Use PRs instead of issues for RFCs

We already have a [playbook](../playbooks/rfcs.md) for RFCs. We used to use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/artsy/README/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), but this approach has two drawbacks: 

- it's impossible to add inline or threaded comments to an issue, and the conversation can become very hard to follow
- it's impossible to tell from the list of closed issues which RFCs were accepted, and which rejected

Changing our process to use PRs that create documents within an RFC directory solves these two problems.
