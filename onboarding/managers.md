## Onboarding For Managers

### Before Day 1

- [ ] Choose a peer mentor for the new hire
- [ ] Choose a spirit guide for the new hire (consult with People Ops)
- [ ] Create
      [an onboarding github issue](https://github.com/artsy/potential/issues/new?template=engineering-onboarding.md)🔒
      based on the onboarding template. Also invite the team to say hi, as this is a place that the new hire should
      always be able to find easily in the future.
- [ ] Set first-week schedule and let the new hire know their first day schedule on their private email account, as
      there will be a period where their machine is still being setup and they won’t yet have access to their
      calendar.
- [ ] Invite new hire to all engineering-wide meetings
- [ ] Determine [sprint rotation plan](/onboarding/sprint-rotation.md)

### Day 1

- [ ] Organize lunch outing (probably to Tataki!)
- [ ] Give an overview of what the onboarding will look like. This is a good time to walk through the onboarding
      template.
- [ ] Introduce new hire to their mentor
- [ ] When they are set up with Slack add them to the `@developers`
      [user group](https://artsy.slack.com/admin/user_groups) 🔒, which should automatically invite them to
      developer related channels, and invite them to channels relevant to the individual

### Week 1

- [ ] Schedule a check-in towards the end of the week

### And onward!

- [ ] When the new hire is assigned to an initial product team, work with the PM/tech lead of that team to make
      sure they are set up and invited to all relevant meetings.
- [ ] Remind tech leads/PMs that are part of the sprint rotation to prepare resources and invite new hire to
      meetings

## Onboarding New Managers

- [ ] Invite to meetings relevant to managers.
- [ ] Invite to engineering onboarding calendar.
- [ ] Remind tech-leads/PMs that the new manager’s main objective is to get to meet and work with everybody. As
      such they should be given diverse tasks and e.g. coupled with various engineers for pairing sessions, as well
      as leaving them with time to have 1:1s with all the engineers (including tech-lead), PM, and designer.
