## Onboarding For Managers

### Before Day 1

- [ ] Choose an [onboarding mentor](/onboarding/mentors.md#the-onboarding-mentor) for the new hire. 
- [ ] Create [an onboarding github issue](https://github.com/artsy/potential/issues/new?template=engineering-onboarding.md) based on the onboarding template. Tag the onboarding mentor and label the issue as `onboarding`. Also invite the team to say hi, as this is a place that the new hire should always be able to find easily in the future.
- [ ] Set first-week schedule
- [ ] Invite new hire to all engineering-wide meetings
- [ ] Determine [sprint rotation plan](/onboarding/sprint-rotation.md) and update the [onboarding calendar](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Onboarding-Rotations-073f98b82d4840aaa0b2bba71343e7cc)ðŸ”’ accordingly

### Day 1

- [ ] Organize lunch outing, if applicable
- [ ] Ask the new hire for their GitHub account. One can use their personal account. Invite them to Artsy Git and the Engineering and Engineering Staff teams.
- [ ] Set up their [AWS account](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Add-a-new-AWS-user-c140d2ed914d4886a6359ff7f381ff0b)ðŸ”’. For consistency, it is encouraged to use the same name as their GitHub username.
- [ ] Invite them to [DataDog](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/users/invite)ðŸ”’
- [ ] Invite the new starter to [OpsGenie](https://artsy.app.opsgenie.com/teams/dashboard/ee381004-a72e-42ef-a733-b350d6693c6c/members)ðŸ”’ and add them to the [on-call rotations calendar](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Incident-Handling-111cab0764a0808c993ec19b352cfab9?pvs=4#111cab0764a080f2a798e717a1610c46)ðŸ”’.
- [ ] Give an overview of what the onboarding will look like. This is a good time to walk through the onboarding template.
- [ ] Introduce new hire to their mentor
- [ ] When they are set up with Slack add them to the `@developers` [user group](https://artsy.slack.com/admin/user_groups) ðŸ”’, which should automatically invite them to developer related channels, and invite them to channels relevant to the individual. As a non Slack Admin, you can search `@developer` on slack, click on it in one of the results. A User Groups tab will apear on the right side. You can edit the group members there.

### Week 1

- [ ] Schedule a check-in towards the end of the week

### And onward!

- [ ] When the new hire is assigned to an initial product team, work with the PM/tech lead of that team to make sure they are set up and invited to all relevant meetings.
- [ ] Remind tech leads/PMs/EMs that are part of the sprint rotation to prepare resources and invite new hire to meetings

## Onboarding New Managers

- [ ] Invite to meetings relevant to managers.
- [ ] Remind tech-leads/PMs that the new managerâ€™s main objective is to get to meet and work with everybody. As such they should be given diverse tasks and e.g. coupled with various engineers for pairing sessions, as well as leaving them with time to have 1:1s with all the engineers (including tech-lead), PM, and designer.
