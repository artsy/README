# Mentorship at Artsy

## Why Mentor
One of Artsy's core values is that [People are Paramount](/culture/what-is-artsy.md#people-are-paramount). As a company we try to meet this in a number of ways, from all the work of People Ops to Ongoing development conversations between employees and managers. As an engineering team we also try to reflect this value by encouraging mentoring among peers.

What does this look like in practice? In an ideal world it would be automatic and spontaneous between every member of the team. Some of our [engineering principles](https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#readme) appeal explicitly to this ideal - **Psychological Safety**, **Leverage Your Impact**, **De-silo Engineers** and **Being Nice is Nice** stand out - while others like **Open Source by Default** and **Incremental Revolution**, while technical on the surface have clear analogues in how we work together. In practice we understand that all of these ideals require intentional work and iteration between people to make them reality. Artsy mentors, assigned when a new engineer joins the team, work to bridge that gap.

## What makes a good mentor
The role of a mentor is purposely different from that of a manager or technical lead, and that role shifts to accommodate the needs of a team member. There may be multiple overlapping descriptions - a mentor may be someone who
- *Facilitates onboarding*: Simply someone who can help a new hire smooth out the bumps of getting onboarded.
- *Knows how things work*: From a non-judgmental sounding board for [<strike>stupid</strike> questions](#simple-answers-to-common-questions) to someone who can simply help find the best point person or stakeholder for a project.
- *Facilitates career development*: From apprenticeship to pointing someone in the direction of an article, project or pair where they can learn something new, mentoring pairs can help uncover or set new goals and offer help in meeting them.

It's up to the mentoring pair to find what works best for them and to ensure the relationship evolves over time to remain useful.

## How to mentor
*Moving from the abstract to the concrete:*

### Your first day
- Keep tabs on your mentee's schedule. Their first day will be full of paperwork and meetings with People Ops but some good tasks for a mentor:
  - Introduce yourself
  - Set a time for an [introductory coffee or tea](#your-first-meeting)
  - Get in touch with the mentee's manager
  - (Re-)familiarize yourself with people resources across the company that will be important to your mentee:
    - Point people in Workplace & People Ops
    - Their manager
    - Their team lead
    - Artsy atlas, calendars, benefit websites, mail filters, Jira and Github management tools...
  

### Your first meeting
Get to know each other. This can be a nice, casual conversation. Focus on active listening.
- Talk about your own history at and before joining Artsy
- Where are they coming from?
  - If they will be remote, where are they from? What is it like there & what works for them in terms of remote work?
  - Are they new in town? Where do they live, for how long? Just have a normal conversation.
- Prior experience with our [technology stacks](/playbooks/technology-choices.md) (and others)
- Other relevant past experience, particularly 'soft skills' that might seem orthogonal to writing code
- Are they using the [onboarding checklist](https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/engineering-onboarding.md)? If so, check in on where they are and offer to be a resource on things there. Some tasks might stand out as good things to do in between People Ops meetings, while working nearby each other or to pair on.

### Your first week
- Check in to make sure your onboardee is moving forward in their checklist. Common stumbling areas include stale steps in the developer setup and getting invited to myriad organizations, lists and websites (slack, jira, github, notion, heroku, aws+hokusai, zeplin, ...)
- Look for chances to pair or work alongside one another throughout the week.
  - If their early work hasn't exposed them to `artsy/gravity`, consider pairing on something trivial or just setting it up, breaking and fixing a test.
  - If they haven't set up hokusai yet, consider pairing on that.
- Try to have another meeting towards the end of the week- **especially** if they are leaving New York. Revisit things you talked about in the first meeting and look for areas that could have gone better. Consider amending relevant documents like this one.

### Your first year
- New hires usually begin with a sprint-by-sprint rotation through our teams, a whirlwind that can last upwards of 2 months. It's good to check in with your mentee during this time.
- Consider reaching out to other mentors as well
- Periodically check in with yourself on what you think you know about your mentee:
  - How are they feeling at work? It's good to be aware (if you can) of comfort level, new technologies and more dynamic pieces of how they are getting situated at Artsy.
  - Are there any opportunities to pair together (or for them to pair with someone else) on a new technology or domain area?
- Many mentoring pairs continue scheduling semi-weekly coffee chats in the weeks and months going forward. As the relationship becomes less formal these can be great to keep in touch with a team member you have a special relationship with!

## Footnotes
#### Additional Context
- [Blog post on professional development at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/09/22/professional-development-at-artsy-engineering/)
- [Onboarding Home](/onboarding)
- There exist other conceptions of mentorship- an apprenticeship for example, or the more long-term relationship between an experienced practitioner 'championing' a new developer as they enter the industry. This guide isn't meant to replace or erase any other definition, and is strictly about mentorship 'at Artsy.'
- Related to mentors but generally coming from a non-engineering role, at Artsy we offer each new team member a *spirit guide*— a tenured team member who works in a different part of the company and support the onboarding employee’s transition to Artsy.  Who listens, offers advice and helps new teammates feel comfortable in their new work environment.

#### Simple answers to common questions
Some common (but certainly not stupid) questions that mentors are well-positioned to address
- *Setup step `x` didn't work*
  - Try to work through it together with them- then create an issue or PR a fix if possible
- *What meetings are 'mandatory', 'encouraged' or just open to folks who are interested?* 
  - Calendar invites and new notification grooming seems to be one of the trickiest parts of the onboarding process, especially through team sprint rotations, but it's important to make sure that each new hire feels fully included as soon as possible. Consider showing off your own processes (and helping make sure they are getting all the right invitations)
- *When should I show up?*
  - Use your judgement, but communicate your availability when working remotely via slack and the OOO calendar.
- *How/should I take vacation?*
  - Yes. Talk to your manager and make sure it is on the OOO calendar.
- *How long until I am fully onboarded/up to speed?*
  - Aside from the team sprint rotations we dont have a firm number for this. Keep in touch with each other and, work together to set longer-term goals- encouraging them to work with their manager as well.
- Who should I talk to or where should I post in slack about `x`?
  - Answer varies- when in doubt, ask your mentor. For lots of questions when getting started with a new technology our [tech learning document](/resources/tech-learning.md) is a great start!
