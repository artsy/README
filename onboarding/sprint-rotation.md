## Sprint Rotation

Once an engineer has gone through general onboarding and done some basic set-up, they'll spend the following few sprints rotating through a variety of engineering teams.

### Why rotate?

We want engineers to be familiar with the full breadth of products, systems, and people at Artsy, but at a comfortable pace. Rather than immediately joining a team for the long-term and focusing on that team's priorities, rotations allow engineers to tour the teams, get to know other engineers, and touch a variety of layers and systems. These rotations may influence the choice of team an engineer joins, or may just provide valuable context to their future work.

### How do sprint rotations work?

Managers will arrange for new engineers to join a sequence of 3 or more teams for 1 sprint each. Emphasis should be on encountering a variety of teams and technology rather than having impact in a familiar space. Following these rotations, the engineer will join a team on a more stable basis.

#### Managers' responsibilities

- Taking into account other rotating engineers and individual teams' schedules, managers decide an appropriate sequence of rotations and add each to the [engineering onboarding Notion page](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Onboarding-Rotations-073f98b82d4840aaa0b2bba71343e7cc)ðŸ”’.
- For each rotation, managers should nominate a "buddy" from the team. This other engineer can help the new engineer get set up, pair on their own sprint work, and be a primary point of contact for context about tickets and projects. A new hire's [mentor](/onboarding/mentors.md) is a great choice for initial rotation "buddy."
- Collaborate with each team's technical lead to ensure a healthy backlog of [`good-first-issue`s](https://artsyproduct.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20good-first-issue).

#### New engineers' responsibilities

- Engineers should join team slack channels, distribution lists, and events. You can join the team's google groups by going to this [URL](https://groups.google.com/all-groups). If you have any issues joining the group, please let your manager know.
- When possible, pair with your buddy or other team members on their sprint work.
- When a pair isn't available, it can be useful to work independently on:
  - setting up development environments for the team's major systems
  - reviewing the [team's documentation](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Product-470238180cf94c87906ef1d3ee259e05)ðŸ”’
  - [`good-first-issue` tickets](https://artsyproduct.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20good-first-issue) within the team's backlog
- Schedule a convenient time (30 minutes should be sufficient) with the product manager to be introduced to the team's goals and metrics.
- The [in-progress][team process handbook](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Team-Process-Handbook-3fbeb0ae934d48ca9074131331b46cff)ðŸ”’ covers many of the events and practices that are common among teams.
