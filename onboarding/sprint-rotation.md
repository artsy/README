# Sprint Rotation

Once an engineer has gone through general onboarding and done some basic set-up, they'll spend the following few sprints rotating through a variety of engineering teams.

## Why rotate?

We want engineers to be familiar with the full breadth of products, systems, and people at Artsy, but at a comfortable pace. Rather than immediately joining a team for the long-term and focusing on that team's priorities, rotations allow engineers to tour the teams, get to know other engineers, and touch a variety of layers and systems. These rotations may influence the choice of team an engineer joins, or may just provide valuable context to their future work.

## How do sprint rotations work?

Managers will arrange for new engineers to join a sequence of 2 or more teams for 1 sprint each. Emphasis should be on encountering a variety of teams and technology rather than having impact in a familiar space. Following these rotations, the engineer will join a team on a more stable basis.

### Managers' responsibilities

- For each rotation, managers should nominate a "[rotation buddy](#rotation-buddy-responsibilities)" from the team. A new hire's [mentor](/onboarding/mentors.md) is a great choice for initial rotation "buddy."

### Rotation buddy responsibilities
- You are the primary point of contact for the new engineer. Help them feel welcomed in the team and support them when they get stuck. 
- Schedule a 1:1 to get to know them and learn about their rotation expectations. 
- Ensure the new engineer is invited to all the relevant team meetings and team-specific channels.
- Help the new starter set up any tools or projects that the team is using. 
- Set aside time to pair with on their first ticket they are interested in working on.

### New engineers' responsibilities

- Engineers should join team slack channels, distribution lists, and events. You can join the team's google groups by going to this [URL](https://groups.google.com/all-groups) 🔒. If you have any issues joining the group, please let your manager know.
- When possible, pair with your buddy or other team members on their sprint work.
- When a pair isn't available, it can be useful to work independently on:
  - setting up development environments for the team's major systems
  - reviewing the [team's documentation](https://www.notion.so/artsy/c729f52babc34f59bf47dbfbe2456d19?v=184cab0764a080d38737000c1da4917d)🔒
- Schedule a convenient time (30 minutes should be sufficient) with the product manager to be introduced to the team's goals and metrics.
- Schedule brief 1:1s with the other team members. Networking is an essential part of rotations. It enables you to get to know the organization through other people's experiences and understand what different folks in the team are doing. 
- The [in-progress][team process handbook](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Team-Process-Handbook-3fbeb0ae934d48ca9074131331b46cff)🔒 covers many of the events and practices that are common among teams.
