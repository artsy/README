## Artsy Engineering Operations

### Product & Engineering Teams

Artsy product engineering is organized in product teams. Each team has a _purpose_, eg. _"Help galleries get the
most out of Artsy and run their business better"_, and Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, eg. _"The number of
artworks uploaded by partners."_ Each team has members with different responsibilities, including a _Product
Manager_, a _Designer_, a _Technical Lead_ and _Engineers_, depending on size. Sometimes the same person wears
multiple hats.

You can see this organization
[in the Product section of Notion ðŸ”‘](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Product-470238180cf94c87906ef1d3ee259e05).

## Request For Comments

A Request For Comments (or RFC) is how we change things, by opening a discussion
that everyone can participate in and deciding if we want to move forward with the suggested change or not.

RFCs should be created by authoring a markdown file in the `/RFCs` folder and then
opening a pull request. [Read the full playbook][rfc_playbook] for all the details!

[rfc_playbook]: /playbooks/rfcs.md
