## Artsy Engineering Operations

### Product & Engineering Teams

Artsy product engineering is organized in product teams. Each team has a _purpose_, eg. _"Help galleries get the
most out of Artsy and run their business better"_, and Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, eg. _"The number of
artworks uploaded by partners."_ Each team has members with different responsibilities, including a _Product
Manager_, a _Designer_, a _Technical Lead_ and _Engineers_, depending on size. Sometimes the same person wears
multiple hats.

You can see this organization
[in the Product section of Notion ðŸ”‘](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Product-470238180cf94c87906ef1d3ee259e05).

Engineers typically work on a product team and may also belong to an _Engineering Practice_.
