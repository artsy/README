# Engineering Ladder

This documents Artsy's Engineering Ladder. The Engineering Ladder is a framework to help evaluate performance,
goals, and compensation for engineers at Artsy. Our ladder was first established and opened in 2015, which you can
read more about [on our blog](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/04/03/artsy-engineering-compensation-framework/).

Since then Artsy has synced up with the Artsy
[company-wide framework ðŸ”‘](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SJXiaA5TYQxqDQmOiVG5NjLj3FFaAAC6aFVVB40bUAs/edit#gid=1182416267)
for levels and titles and we have added Technical Lead levels to the framework.

This document is open and evolving. We encourage you to submit issues or pull requests to suggest changes and
ensure our framework is doing the best it can to help Artsy fairly evaluate compensation and career growth for
engineers.

## Tracks

The Engineering Ladder encapsulates two tracksâ€”an individual contributor (IC2â€“IC8) and manager track (M2â€“M6). The
manager track is available to engineers who have achieved an "IC5 Senior Engineer" level on the individual
contributor ladder.

| Individual Contributor | Artsy IC Level | Artsy M Level | Manager                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Intern                 | Intern         |               |                                |
| Engineer 1             | IC2            |               |                                |
| Engineer 2             | IC3            |               |                                |
| Senior Engineer 1      | IC4            | M2            | Engineering Manager 1          |
| Senior Engineer 2      | IC5            | M3            | Engineering Manager 2          |
| Staff Engineer         | IC6            | M4            | Senior Engineering Manager     |
| Senior Staff Engineer  | IC7            | M5            | Director of Engineering        |
| Principal Engineer     | IC8            | M6            | Senior Director of Engineering |

### How promotions work

TODO

## Individual Contributors

Individual contributor engineers define a "maker" role at Artsy where a person is responsible for writing code on a
regular basis and has no direct reports. As an individual contributor engineer grows at Artsy the scale and impact
of the code they write and systems they maintain is expected to increase.

From one level to another, the scope of direct impact gradually increases and so does the sphere of influence.
Increased mastery is a necessary condition but isn't sufficient to expand impact.

```
Scope of impact:     Self     >        Team          >  Teams  > Org
Level          : Eng 1, Eng 2 > Sen Eng 1, Sen Eng 2 >  Staff  > Sen Staff+
```

### tl;dr

- Intern: focuses on learning core skills and applying them to deliver business value
  - TODO: This level still needs to be added to the ladder.
- Engineer 1 (IC2): Focuses on being an effective individual contributor.
- Engineer 2 (IC3): Is an effective team member.
- Senior Engineer 1 (IC4): Consistently drives change and impact across a significant portion of their product
  team.
- Senior Engineer 2 (IC5): Consistently drives change and impact across their whole product team.
- Staff Engineer (IC6): can drive change and impact across multiple teams.
- Senior Staff Engineer (IC7): can drive change and impact across full Product, Data, Design and Engineering
  organization
  - TODO: This level still needs to be added to the ladder.

_Note: This ladder is heavily inspired by
[Better's Technical Career Ladder](https://better.engineering/technical-career-ladder/) and
[Rent the Runway's Engineering Ladder](https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder), which we believe have the
appropriate levels of specificity to enable meaningful career development conversations._

### Evaluation criteria

- Knowledge Leadership
  - Level of knowledge in a specific business area
  - Breadth and depth of technical and soft skills
- Impact
  - Nature and impact of problems solved and decisions made
  - Value delivered to the business and team
- Influence
  - Nature and level of influence on projects, strategy, and internal and external contacts
  - Effect on people around you and team dynamics
- Discretion
  - Nature of guidance received
  - Nature of guidance provided to others

### Bragging Document
It can be helpful to maintain a bragging document to really understand the ladder and also to get your work recognized. Julia Evan has put it really well in her [blog post](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) explaining that neither you nor your manager will remember everything you did. To help you track your work and also get alignment with your manager on where you are standing in terms of performance you can use this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yPZeLhkFjlEMUfstDvOXxQXLqBKmr-I-xD0uUwdO2Zc/edit#gid=0) as a base for your bragging. It also contains some real world bragging examples of fellow Artsy engineers.


### Visualisation

To help with the visualisation of the ladder we have created this visual, inspired by [honeycomb.io](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/engineering-levels-at-honeycomb/). It is not perfect but it allows for a quick overview of the levels in terms of impact as well as ownership. We wanted to show that each level encompasses the previous levels and there is flexibility in how to interpret and operate on each level based on individual interests. As mentioned in the linked article "...someone might operate at a higher level of ownership in a smaller scope or at a smaller level of ownership at a larger scope, or somewhere in between. Of course, there is value in growing in both dimensions, but it is more common to stretch in one direction or the other at any given point."

## Technical Leads

Every team at Artsy has a Technical Lead who is part of the Core Team (Product Manager, Technical Lead, Data Analyst, Product Designer and Engineering Manager). The Technical Lead's key responsibilities are:

- Partnering closely with the rest of the Core Team to jointly lead the team and deliver business value effectively (including proactively defining team strategy, roadmap, project scoping and milestone definitions, etc.)
- Driving the team's technology choices and aligning their decisions with the rest of the Engineering organization
- Ensuring successful project delivery.

Taking on a Technical Lead role is a great opportunity for someone to expand their impact (including to expand scope, to achieve team wide impact, or to pave the way towards an Engineering Management career). Throughout their career, an Individual Contributor or an Engineering Manager may swap in and out of this Technical Lead role.

See
[this document](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Artsy-Tech-Lead-Expanded-Responsibilities-Public-710ee0cd2fce47dcaa722ece80e365b2)
for an expanded set of Tech Lead Responsibilities at Artsy.

## Engineering Management

A managerâ€™s role at Artsy balances people management responsibilities with team delivery responsibilities. 
As a people manager, they are responsible for hiring, retaining, growing and managing the performance of their reports.
Additionally, they're expected to significantly impact teams' success through their own technical contribution and/or delivery management. Delivery management is broadly defined here as any non-coding activity that will help the team ship faster, with better quality, and with increased impact (for instance: improving team processes, mitigating risks around release planning, facilitating internal and external communication).
As an engineering manager grows at Artsy, their scope of impact will increase from one team to multiple teams and from managing ICs to managing ICs and other EMs.

### tl;dr

- Engineering Manager 1: Transitional from an Individual Contributor role, the main focus is learn how to manage
  people.
- Engineering Manager 2: Proficient at managing 6+ Individual Contributors and act as a delivery multiplier on
  their team.
- Senior Engineering Manager: Has meaningful delivery impact across multiple teams and starts having engineering
  org wide impact, can start learning how to manage managers.
- Director of Engineering: Proficient at managing Engineering Managers and has consistent engineering org wide
  impact.
- Senior Director of Engineering: Has consistent company wide impact.
