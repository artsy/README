# Web Practice Reading List

A reading list that is useful for on-boarding to the web practice technologies.

### Firstly it's important to know the language well.

- [JavaScript the Good Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook)
- [Coffeescript Docs](http://coffeescript.org/)

### Next it's important to know Node.js.

- [Node official website](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Original node.js presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztspvPYybIY) (this was when Ryan was learning the
  art of public speaking so don't feel the need to stick through the whole thing)
- [Beginner Tutorial](http://www.nodebeginner.org/)
- [Neat overview article](http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js)

### Get familiar with what Force talks to -- our JSON HTTP API (api.artsy.net)

Simply put our API is a Ruby powered web server the serves up our data in JSON form.

- [Learn REST](http://rest.elkstein.org/)
- [Grape a Ruby framework that powers our API](https://github.com/intridea/grape)

### Get to know some of the popular tools Force is built on.

- Popular Node framework: [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- Popular front-end framework: [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
- A templating language that we use to write HTML: [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
- A stylesheet language we use to write CSS: [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
- Unit testing framework: [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)

### We do something quite unique and bleeding edge at Artsy that's being coined as "isomorphic javascript".

- [AirBnB blog post explaining isomorphic Javascript](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/)
  and [similar slides](http://www.slideshare.net/spikebrehm/a-28174727)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)—The node tool we use to share modules between Node & the browser

### Finally, read up on our open source boilerplate which is just a light-weight combination of the above things.

- [Project website](http://ezeljs.com/)
- [Blog post introducing it](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/11/30/rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/)

Good luck, and please ask any questions in the [#web Slack channel](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/web/).
