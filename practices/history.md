title: The history of practices at Artsy
description: How did we get to where we are
---

Artsy has been transparent with its history; you can find a lot of blog posts documenting our team
structures at the time and their trade-offs. Internally we're also transparent, and you can access all historical
emails sent to `team@artsymail.com`. This is particularly useful when looking for announcements. For example, here are
all the emails
[from orta](https://groups.google.com/a/artsymail.com/forum/#!topicsearchin/team/author$3Aorta@artsymail.com) ðŸ”’ to
the team.

So, let's use `team@artsymail.com` as a tool to find out how the Artsy engineering team has evolved.

In the beginning, there were just engineers. We were a small team with only really ~4 main projects
(Gravity/Folio/CMS/Admin), which kept communication overhead low, so there was little need for sub-teams.

Between 2013-2014 we:

- Created a
  [Partner Engineering team](https://groups.google.com/a/artsymail.com/d/msg/team/ya_L3I_1TCk/kE7uGKRd8JAJ) ðŸ”’
- Created a [Mobile Team](https://groups.google.com/a/artsymail.com/d/msg/team/AgZSIEjZVs4/KDWTTRNEltQJ) ðŸ”’

Which was mixed with a set of full-stack engineers working on the website and its corresponding platform work. We
stayed technology-focused until 2015 when our teams
[switched](https://groups.google.com/a/artsymail.com/d/msg/team/tHZ_lfJQH9Y/cQQKlwIcCwAJ) ðŸ”’ to be based around the
type of business stakeholders:

- Gallery Tools and Services
- Gallery SaaS
- Artsy.net
- Artsy iOS
- Auctions
- Messaging
- Publishing

The stakeholder-oriented teams left space for folks to think about how things should work across an entire technology stack.
This was the creation of practices at Artsy; we had three of them:

- Web
- Platform
- Mobile

The product teams [simplified](https://groups.google.com/a/artsymail.com/d/msg/team/hwLvMwuBmJo/8xGcssucBwAJ) ðŸ”’
this down into four major teams at the start of 2016:

- Auctions
- Collector Experience & GMV
- Partner Success & Revenue
- Publishing

However, practices remain the same.

With the Mobile team using React Native, when the lead of the web practice
[left Artsy](https://groups.google.com/a/artsymail.com/d/msg/team/SQaJc-oMhZM/QlZEqIVICQAJ) ðŸ”’. We consolidated the
Web and Mobile practices into a generic "front-end" practice. This was due to the amount of shared infrastructure,
people, and concerns between the two.

Then in early 2019, we
[split those](https://github.com/artsy/README/commit/004b7b9b1a6f8facdd8ab9f4535d6b993f240b78#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8)
practices back out into front-end iOS and front-end Web.
