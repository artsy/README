### Practices

Practices are how we handle cross-cutting concerns across product teams, they are light-weight team structures
which come together regularly to discuss.

Practices can be useful for experimenting, debating, and deciding about engineering-wide concerns. Once a
significant project or time investment is required, it's most effective to allocate work to dedicated teams (for
prioritization, visibility, and capacity purposes). The
[project list](https://www.notion.so/artsy/17c4b550458a4cb8bcbf1b68060d63e6?v=2b874803f96c483bbdc2e80b7fbd25f9)ðŸ”’
is useful for deciding how to organize and divide large efforts up among product teams.

See [the Practice Playbook](/practices/playbook.md#readme) for tips on running a practice.
