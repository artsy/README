### How Artsy systems work

The documents in this section aim to provide a high-level understanding of how specific systems at Artsy function. These systems often span multiple services and repositories. Each document offers a gentle introduction, using tools like sequence diagrams and pseudo-code, before you delve into the actual codebases. Our goal is to bridge the gap in cross-repository documentation, making it easier to understand the architecture and interactions of Artsy's core functionalities.
