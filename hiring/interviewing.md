## What to expect from an Artsy interview

We're excited that you've decided to interview for a job at, the best company in the world, Artsy! This document will cover our standard interview
process. Our goal is to give you the information you need to feel prepared.

We'll update this as often as we can when things change, but note that the details may shift slightly. Our
Recruitment team will be available to answer any questions you may have throughout the hiring process!

This guide is tailored to our standard interviews for most individual-contributor roles. The content of the
interviews may change slightly based on the level, but the ethos will be the same.

At a high level, our interviews have three phases:

- [**Phone screen**](#phone-screen): Short chats with a recruiter and (often) an engineering manager.
- [**On-site**](#on-site-interview): Our standard interview loop. Includes four interviews with engineers and
  non-engineers.
- [**References**](#references): Three professional references (this part is the same for interviews across Artsy).

### Phone Screen

As a very first step, you’ll speak with one of our recruiters and perhaps an engineering manager. These
conversations are a way for us to learn more about you, what motivates you, and gauge whether Artsy and the
opportunity is a good fit for your career goals.

**How to prepare** Be prepared to speak to the work you’ve accomplished on your resume—we may ask you to describe a
recent project and/or specific technologies you’ve used in the past. Also make sure to come prepared with questions
to ask your interviewer. Remember, this is also for _you_ to make sure Artsy would be a good fit!

### "On-site" Interview

During your "on-site," you will usually participate in four 30 minute interviews and one 60 minute interview:

#### 1. Hiring Manager

This interview is with the hiring manager for the role. The hiring manager will be an Engineering Manager on the
team, and in _most_ cases, will be your people manager if you are to join Artsy.

This interview focuses on the capabilities described in [our engineering ladder](/careers/ladder.md#readme). You
will not be asked to whiteboard, but be prepared to talk about past experiences working on teams or projects.

#### 2. Peer (Engineer)

This interview will be with an engineer. We have a semi-fluid team structure, so this person may or may not be on
the same team as this role.

The goal of this interview is to learn about your experience collaborating with other engineers. Like the hiring
manager interview, this is non-technical but be prepared to discuss past experiences.

#### 3. Peer (Non-Engineer)

This interview will be with a member of our Product, Design or Data teams.

Similar to the Peer (Engineer) interview above, this is non-technical but you should be prepared to discuss past
experiences and especially collaborations with non-technical colleagues.

#### 4. Technical Fluency

This interview will be with an engineer. The focus of this interview varies for different levels and specialties.
Most likely, the person you interview with will be someone with experience relevant to the role.

You will not be asked to code but we will dig into the technical details of projects you've worked on. In general,
we care more about hearing how you think through problems vs. whether you're familiar with a specific technology.

Some advice: dig into the details! Talk about how you approached problems and why. We like to hear your thought
process but also understand if you need a few moments to think before answering-- let us know if this is the case,
and don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions!

#### 5. System Design

This interview is with an engineer, and lasts an hour. Here, you will be presented a scenario and asked to design a
system\*. You are expected to take us through your thought process and may use a whiteboard (or equivalent in a
remote setup) to explain your work, but you will not be asked to code anything.

In this interview, we're evaluating the following key areas:

- Systems thinking: Are you able to both think holistically about the problem and dig into details?
- Decision-making: What factors are you employing when making decisions? Can you explain why you chose X or Y?
- Communication: We want to hear your thought-process and assumptions as you make them.

\*"System" is used generically here to represent a chunk of an ecosystem. We tailor the prompt to the specific
role, so for example if it's an iOS role, you may be asked to design a feature in an iOS app; if it's a full stack
role, it could be something like a simple architecture for notifications. We're not trying to trick you here or
catch you out, we just want hear how you leverage your knowledge and experience.

### References

Based on feedback from these interviews, we'll ask to connect with your professional references.

References are an important part of Artsy's hiring strategy across all roles. We’ll ask for three references—these
should be a combination of direct managers and close collaborators. If you’re unable to provide three (i.e. if
you’ve been in the same job your whole career), let us know and we'll figure something out!

During these calls, we'll ask your references in-depth questions about their experience working with you. See
[this blog post on hiring](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/artsy-engineering-hiring/) for more details.

### General Tips

- Feel free to take a few moments of quiet time if you need them throughout the interview, but make sure you are
  also _thinking out loud_. By letting us hear your thought-process, we can also help guide you towards the topics
  we’re interested in hearing about most!
- Bring questions for your interviewers. Use the opportunity to make sure that Artsy is the type of company that
  you'd be excited to work at. Feel free to ask about anything, including: company goals and values, team history,
  etc.
- You are not required to have a deep knowledge of Artsy's product or engineering team before interviewing, but it
  can be helpful to do some research ahead of time as a way to frame your questions or discussion. We recommend
  poking around [artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net/), looking at our [engineering blog](https://artsy.github.io/),
  and checking out our [Artsy in a Nutshell](/culture/what-is-artsy.md#readme) doc in this repo.

  in January of 2019 is still relevant! Details around the exact structure of our interviews is outdated (refer to
  this doc for up-to-date information), but the general approach is the same.
