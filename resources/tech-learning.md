# Tech Learning

We often hear that learning to google (or perhaps [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)) and use stack overflow are
the most important core competencies of any programmer, but growth and learning happen best outside the vacuum of
the internet. This page is a list of the engineering team's favorite resources -tutorials, essays, starting points
and general thoughts- on a variety of programming topics.

This is a living document; if you find something out of date or have an addition please open a pull request.

## Good starting points & tools
