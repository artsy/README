description: What is Future Friday?

## Overview

An optional, recurring chance to pursue non-sprint opportunities with a longer time horizon.

- Every other Friday, preferably the last Friday of each sprint, is known as Future Friday.
- Team members are encouraged to pursue non-sprint opportunities with a longer time horizon, but still with
  potential to add significant value. These could include spikes, experiments, higher-risk projects, or sometimes
  just a process improvement or deferred maintenance need. Ideas about such opportunities tend to accumulate over
  the usual course of work.
- Rather than the usual planning and Jira-based processes, team members are expected to simply share what they're
  doing at the beginning of the day, and report back results, lessons, or further opportunities at the end of the
  day. "Failure," or deciding something isn't worth further time, is encouraged. Promising results are welcome as
  well.
- Participation is optional. Team members should exercise judgment and evaluate timeliness of other work or
  collaboration opportunities, as usual. What's important is the vocabulary and the recognition that short-term
  delivery focus can be balanced with more speculative work.
