description: How to evaluate 3rd party vendors
---

Evaluting vendors can be daunting. Here are list of considerations when evaluation a vendor, grouped by larger
themes:

### Cost

- ROI
  - What is the cost of the vendor? How does their fee structure scale?
  - What the value would we get out of integrating with this vendor? Can we put a number on it in terms of
    dollars/engineering hours?

### Ease of integration

- Time to delivery
  - How long would it take to integrate with this vendor?
  - What is the opportunity cost?
- Migration complexity
  - What is the path to integration? Is it complex or straightforward?
  - How fleshed out are the docs?
  - Is there a community of devs using this vendor?
  - Does the vendor use well-accepted protocols or their own proprietary implementations?
  - Do we have to replace an in-house solution? How does that affect the integration plan?

### Feature set

- Does it solve our problem?
  - If it is not perfect for our use case, is it good enough?
  - Does the solution scale well? Do you see us continuing using it a year from now? 5 years from now?
  - Does it offer UI/brand customization? Do we need UI/brand customization now? Will we in the future?
- Vendor qualities
  - Are they the experts in this problem space?
  - What stage of the company is the vendor in? Could that affect integration or support?
  - How fast is the technology or problem space changing? Is the vendor responsive to these changes?

### Vendor lock-in

- Migrating off
  - Would to be hard to migrate off this vendor if we change our minds?
  - Is the integration very custom to our stack?
  - Is there a data export feature? Is the data export protocol established industry standard or proprietary?
- Vendor Ecosystem
  - Is there any convenience we gain from staying within the vendor ecosystem?
  - Is the ecosystem we're locked in good enough? Could we revisit other options when we have more capacity?

### Compliance/Legal

- Legal risk
  - Does this vendor cover our legal risk?
  - Does this vendor expose us to more legal risk?
  - Are there privacy concerns?
  - Will the vendor require access to our code base?

### Company-level Strategy

- Strategic alignment
  - Does the solution this vendor offers align with our company strategy?
