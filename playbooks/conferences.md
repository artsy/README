# Conferences

We encourage engineers to attend and speak at conferences. It is a great way to stay up-to-date with the industry,
be inspired by challenges others are facing, develop one's career, and connect with the community. Here are some
guidelines:

## Attending Conferences

- We aim for each engineer to be able to attend a conference every year, subject to budget. The conference should
  be related to the individual's role/growth or Artsy's challenges/technologies.
- Please be mindful when expensing your travel. A good rule of thumb is to spend Artsy money like you would your
  own. Refer to [Atlas][travel-and-accommodations-on-atlas] for more details and rate card.
- It's strongly recommended writing up take-aways and sharing with the team upon return, e.g. a list of take-aways
  and links to resources (decks, videos, etc.) shared in relevant Slack channels.

## Speaking at Conferences

- We encourage engineers to speak at conferences, and budget-wise the expense gets higher priority.
- If you need help preparing a conference talk, stop by [Ash][ash]'s weekly Writing Office Hours.
- It's also recommended sharing the talk and lessons with the team.
