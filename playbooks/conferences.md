# Conferences

We encourage engineers to attend and speak at conferences. It is a great way to stay up-to-date with the industry,
be inspired by challenges others are facing, develop one's career, and connect with the community. Here are some
guidelines:

## Attending Conferences

- We have a limited budget for conference attendance, so events should be related to the individual's role/growth
  or Artsy's challenges and technologies.
- Please be mindful when expensing your travel. A good rule of thumb is to spend Artsy money like you would your
  own. Refer to [Travel & Expenses][https://www.notion.so/artsy/Travel-Expenses-b59bec3d17ef44cd9905f1e4a510191d]🔒
  for more details and rate card.
- Writing up take-aways and sharing with the team is appreciated upon return. E.g. a list of take-aways and links
  to resources (decks, videos, etc.) shared in relevant Slack channels.

## Speaking at Conferences

- We encourage engineers to speak at conferences, and budget-wise the expense gets higher priority.
- Sharing the talk and lessons with the team is a great way to prepare.
