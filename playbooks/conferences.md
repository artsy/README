# Conferences

We encourage engineers to attend and speak at conferences. It is a great way to stay up-to-date with the industry,
be inspired by challenges others are facing, develop one's career, and connect with the community. Here are some
guidelines:

## Attending Conferences

- We aim for each engineer to be able to attend a conference every year, subject to budget. The conference should
  be related to the individual's role/growth or Artsy's challenges/technologies.
- Please be mindful when expensing your travel. A good rule of thumb is to spend Artsy money like you would your
  own. Refer to [Atlas][travel-and-accommodations-on-atlas] for more details and rate card.
- It's strongly recommended writing up take-aways and sharing with the team upon return, e.g. a list of take-aways
  and links to resources (decks, videos, etc.) shared in relevant Slack channels.

## Speaking at Conferences

- We encourage engineers to speak at conferences, and budget-wise the expense gets higher priority.
- If you need help preparing a conference talk, stop by [Ash][ash]'s weekly Writing Office Hours.
- It's also recommended sharing the talk and lessons with the team.

## Approval Process

- Find an event (conference/seminar/course) that you would like to attend. Identify items in the agenda that will
  contribute to both your growth goals and Artsy's business goals.
- Estimate any travel or lodging expenses that may be needed to attend the event using Concur to search for airfare
  and hotels.
- Speak to your manager about attending the event before purchasing tickets. Communicate the following items:
  - How will this event contribute to your and your team's goals?
  - What are the dates of the event?
  - What is the attendance fee for the event?
  - What travel and lodging fees will be required?
  - Managers should consider the following:
    - Does the event align with individual and business goals?
    - Does the attendance cost fit within the remaining budget?
    - Is attendance being requested far enough in advance to keep costs low?
    - Have enough engineers being given a chance to attend events?
- Purchase tickets for the event, and start an expense report in Concur or Vistra.
- Make travel and loding arrangements via Concur and submit the expense report for approval.
  - Managers will need to approve travel and lodging expenses above a certain rate, which in some cases can put a
    24-hour hold on itineraries pending approval.
  - For more information, review the [2019 Travel & Expense Policy][2019-travel-and-expense-policy].
- Attend the event! Have fun, and consider sharing what you've learned with the team in our [Conference
  Notes][conference-notes] section.
