To modify Artsy's [draft] technology radar, edit the
[artsy-tech-radar.csv](/playbooks/technology_radar/artsy-tech-radar.csv) file and visit:

https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fartsy%2Freadme%2Fmaster%2Fplaybooks%2Ftechnology_radar%2Fartsy-tech-radar.csv

NOTE: Order matters and there must be each of "adopt," "trial," "assess," and "hold" within the first quadrant or the radar will render rings out of order.
