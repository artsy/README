Metaphysics' v2 schema,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Consumers should switch to v2 rather than make further modifications to v1."
Opaque identifiers,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Friendly identifiers or 'slugs' are fine for URLs but opaque, permanent identifiers are preferred for all internal or programmatic uses."
Split testing,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"When scale permits (such as around high-volume product surfaces or early funnel steps), we prefer to make data-driven product decisions by evaluating user experiences in parallel through A/B- or A/B/*-style tests"
Babel,hold,tools,TRUE,"This is the description. You can use basic html such as the <strong>strong tag to emphasise keywords and phrases</strong> and insert <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com"">anchor links to documentation and referance material</a>."
Rsbuild,adopt,tools,FALSE,""
CircleCI,adopt,tools,FALSE,"for continuous integration over other services like Travis or Semaphore. Shared orbs and contexts help our projects apply best practices."

OpenSearch,adopt,tools,FALSE,""
Fastlane,adopt,tools,FALSE,
Postgresql,adopt,tools,FALSE,"We rely on Heroku or Amazon's RDS to host these databases. Though MongoDB was chosen to host core API data, in the long run we found the data (and maybe all data) to be more relational than document-oriented."
RabbitMQ,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Its stream allows source systems to publish their notable events and other systems to subscribe as desired. This avoids coupling systems directly. After evaluating Kafka for this purpose, we had more operational success with RabbitMQ."

Webpack,hold,tools,FALSE,
Elixir,hold,languages & frameworks,TRUE,
Next.js,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Currently trialing Next.js for our admin apps, via the pages router. See Forque, Volt 2. Some experiments have been made to migrate to Next 13's app router, which have all run into friction. See this <a href='https://artsy.slack.com/archives/C2TQ4PT8R/p1697227679293829'>Slack thread for more info</a>."

Coffeescript,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
Objective-C,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Because we use React Native some amount of Objective-C bridging code will remain necessary, these should be thin layers to swift features. Some legacy core Eigen infrastructure and React Native itself is written in Objective-C."
Scala,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
AWS Lambda,hold,platforms,TRUE,
Google cloud,hold,platforms,FALSE,
Heroku,hold,platforms,FALSE,"We prefer kubernetes where we have shared solutions for authorization, logging, monitoring, alerting, scaling, and routing."
Backends for Frontends,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Rather than tailor backends to particular product surfaces or teams, we strive to serve clients via a unified GraphQL schema, reconciling or disambiguating domain concepts as necessary."
Bug Bounty Program,adopt,techniques,FALSE,
GraphQL Stitching,hold,techniques,TRUE,"We prefer to connect to upstream REST APIs instead of GraphQL APIs."
Hypermedia,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While discoverable and easy to consume, we've found hypermedia APIs inefficient to consume."

Machine facing LLM text generation,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Currently being used for genome bot and artwork captions"
Metaphysics' v1 schema,hold,techniques,TRUE,"The v1 schema is deprecated and should be considered frozen. Consumers should switch to v2 rather than make further modifications to v1."
Serverless architecture,hold,techniques,TRUE,
Consul,hold,tools,FALSE,
LabFeatures (Gravity),hold,tools,TRUE,"Unleash supports similar feature-enabling on an individual account basis, while also being flexible enough for gradual roll-outs and split tests."
MongoDB,hold,tools,FALSE,
Pingdom,hold,tools,TRUE,
Semaphore,hold,tools,FALSE,
SiteFeatures (Gravity),hold,tools,TRUE,"Site Features were used to turn on or off core functionality, but are easily replaced by Unleash (for platform-wide toggles) or Flipper (for Gravity-only settings)."
Split.io,hold,tools,TRUE,"After a trial in the mobile app, we decided not to adopt this split-testing tool broadly (mostly due to cost)"
