GraphQL Stitching,hold,techniques,TRUE,"We prefer to connect to upstream REST APIs instead of GraphQL APIs."
GraphQL,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Appreciated for its flexibility and efficiency for clients."
JSON,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We prefer JSON over most other data formats for its self-describing properties."
Rails,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
React Native,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"New iOS work should use React Native. See also Objective-C."
React.js,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
Relay,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
Ruby,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
Spark,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Artsy manages a Spark cluster and patterns exist to load data from the main Gravity database as well as other systems, distribute processing among all of the available nodes, and interact with S3, HDFS, or Redshift. See the Cinder repo."
SQL,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
styled-components,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
Swift,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We generally opt for React Native, but when necessary for quality, usability or features tightly integrated with OS, we will build native features in Swift using UIKit. see Objective-C."
Typescript,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
UIKit,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"See Objective-C."
AWS,adopt,platforms,FALSE,
Docker,adopt,platforms,FALSE,
HSTS,adopt,platforms,FALSE,
Kubernetes,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"We manage staging and production clusters, and have solutions for logging, monitoring, alerting, scaling, and routing. See Hokusai and Substance repos."
Redis,adopt,platforms,FALSE,
Metaphysics' v2 schema,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Consumers should switch to v2 rather than make further modifications to v1."
Opaque identifiers,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Friendly identifiers or 'slugs' are fine for URLs but opaque, permanent identifiers are preferred for all internal or programmatic uses."
Responsive web pages,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Rather than mobile- or desktop-specific designs, we prefer pages to degrade gracefully."
Split testing,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"When scale permits (such as around high-volume product surfaces or early funnel steps), we prefer to make data-driven product decisions by evaluating user experiences in parallel through A/B- or A/B/*-style tests"
Babel,adopt,tools,TRUE,"This is the description. You can use basic html such as the <strong>strong tag to emphasise keywords and phrases</strong> and insert <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com"">anchor links to documentation and referance material</a>."
CircleCI,adopt,tools,FALSE,"for continuous integration over other services like Travis or Semaphore. Shared orbs and contexts help our projects apply best practices."
Cloudflare,adopt,tools,TRUE,
Datadog APM,adopt,tools,FALSE,
Elasticsearch,adopt,tools,FALSE,"for search, similarity, and sophisticated filtering"
Fastlane,adopt,tools,FALSE,
Grafana,adopt,tools,FALSE,
Postgresql,adopt,tools,FALSE,"We rely on Heroku or Amazon's RDS to host these databases. Though MongoDB was chosen to host core API data, in the long run we found the data (and maybe all data) to be more relational than document-oriented."
RabbitMQ,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Its stream allows source systems to publish their notable events and other systems to subscribe as desired. This avoids coupling systems directly. After evaluating Kafka for this purpose, we had more operational success with RabbitMQ."
Sidekiq,adopt,tools,FALSE,
Terraform,adopt,tools,FALSE,
Webpack,adopt,tools,FALSE,
Elixir,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,
Phoenix,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,
OpsGenie,trial,tools,TRUE,
Unleash,trial,tools,TRUE,"Unleash offers an open-source solution for feature-flagging, gradual roll-outs, and split-testing. Official SDKs simplify consumption from multiple clients and stacks."
VSCode pairing,trial,tools,TRUE,
Redux,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
Apollo Server,assess,platforms,TRUE,
APIs as a product,assess,techniques,TRUE,
GraphQL batching,assess,techniques,TRUE,
Apollo Platform,assess,tools,TRUE,
Datadog Synthetics,assess,tools,TRUE,
HashiCorp Vault,assess,tools,TRUE,
Helm,assess,tools,TRUE,
Coffeescript,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
Objective-C,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Because we use React Native some amount of Objective-C bridging code will remain necessary, these should be thin layers to swift features. Some legacy core Eigen infrastructure and React Native itself is written in Objective-C."
Scala,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,
AWS Lambda,hold,platforms,TRUE,
Google cloud,hold,platforms,FALSE,
Heroku,hold,platforms,FALSE,"We prefer kubernetes where we have shared solutions for authorization, logging, monitoring, alerting, scaling, and routing."
Backends for Frontends,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Rather than tailor backends to particular product surfaces or teams, we strive to serve clients via a unified GraphQL schema, reconciling or disambiguating domain concepts as necessary."
Bug bounties,hold,techniques,FALSE,
Hypermedia,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While discoverable and easy to consume, we've found hypermedia APIs inefficient to consume."
Metaphysics' v1 schema,hold,techniques,TRUE,"The v1 schema is deprecated and should be considered frozen. Consumers should switch to v2 rather than make further modifications to v1."
Serverless architecture,hold,techniques,TRUE,
Consul,hold,tools,FALSE,
Jenkins CI/CD,hold,tools,FALSE,
Kafka,hold,tools,FALSE,
LabFeatures (Gravity),hold,tools,TRUE,"Unleash supports similar feature-enabling on an individual account basis, while also being flexible enough for gradual roll-outs and split tests."
MongoDB,hold,tools,FALSE,
Pingdom,hold,tools,TRUE,
Semaphore,hold,tools,FALSE,
SiteFeatures (Gravity),hold,tools,TRUE,"Site Features were used to turn on or off core functionality, but are easily replaced by Unleash (for platform-wide toggles) or Flipper (for Gravity-only settings)."
Split.io,hold,tools,TRUE,"After a trial in the mobile app, we decided not to adopt this split-testing tool broadly (mostly due to cost)"
Travis CI,hold,tools,TRUE,
