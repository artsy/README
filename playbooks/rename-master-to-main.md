# Guide on how to rename master branches to 'main'

## Starting with the easier repositories

A list of repositories that are not software services or not connected / automatically hooked with software
services and therefor could easily be changing the main branch name to 'main':

Projects that use hokusai for automated deployments but not mission-critical to the Artsy ecosystem:

### Check for open PRs on master

Make sure that after the renaming process the PRs are still open and now pointing to main.

### Update CI and docs

Search the repository for any references to the old `master` branch name and update them to use `main`, especially:

- Continuous integration steps configured in `.circleci/config.yml`
- Any set-up instructions or scripts

Create a pull request with these changes ([e.g.](https://github.com/artsy/doppler/pull/218)), and monitor that they
build and deploy to staging successfully.

### Renaming the Remote master Branch

Make sure you are on your local master branch and also pulled the latest changes.

Because on Github you probably configured the `master` branch as the default branch. To configure the main branch
as default, go to the settings/branches and change the default branch to main.

Now every team member needs to update their local default branch. This is what you can see on GitHub once the
master branch is renamed. You can copy the commands from the section
[Team Duties after rename](#team-duties-after-rename) below. There are two options listed, a complicated and an
easier way üòÑ.

### Team Duties after rename

The complicated way:

```bash
# Switch to the "master" branch:
$ git checkout master

# Rename it to "main":
$ git branch -m master main

# Get the latest commits (and branches!) from the remote:
$ git fetch origin

# Create a new tracking connection with the new "origin/main" branch:
$ git branch -u origin/main main

# Reset the remote head to main:
$ git remote set-head origin -a
```

The easy way:

```bash
# fetch main
$ git fetch origin main

# get the remote main branch and check it out locally
$ git checkout main

# delete local master branch
$ git branch -D master
```


### Release Automation

If the project's release pipeline is automated with [Horizon](https://github.com/artsy/horizon/), edit the
project's "stages":

- Login to https://releases.artsy.net/admin/projects 
- Find the project in Horizon's project list, click "edit."
- Click "stages" to list the stages and "edit" to edit the `master` branch.
- Update the name and branch fields to be `main` as mentioned in the doc. 
- Click `Update` to save.

### External tools

Since we haver external tools that are not possible to map by checking the repository code itself, this is something we need to consider as a Team duties after rename as well.
Well known tools that are not easy to map:
 - Jenkins
