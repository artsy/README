# Team working agreement

The purpose of the working agreement is to ensure the team shares responsibility in defining expectations for how they will function together and enhance their self-organization process. It creates an awareness of both positive and negative behaviors that can impact the team.

## Creating a team working agreement

### Overview

* This process uncovers the existing norms, both positive and negative, that impact team functioning.
* The goal of a team working agreement is to reinforce positive behaviors while helping our team overcome dysfunctional ones.
* A great set of questions to ask is:
  * What expectations do team members have of each other?
  * What is working well within our team?
  * What is not working well?
  * What should our team keep doing?
  * What should our team start doing?
  * What should our team stop doing?
* Behaviors outlined in social contracts may include any positive behaviors that the team wants to encourage such as:
  * Be honest and transparent with no hidden agendas.
  * Help each other and do not hesitate to ask for help.
  * Have forums to discuss tough issues.
  * Cooperate rather than compete with team members.
* Regularly update the social contract to improve effectiveness.
* Establish up-front how members will handle violations and how we will hold each other accountable for the social contract.

### Procedure

#### 1. Set the stage (3 mins)

* Describe what the purpose of the exercise is:
  * "Becoming a team involves commitment to working together and supporting each other in our common goals. This commitment is supported by writing what all team members believe are important protocols for the team to comply with to maximize their capabilities to deliver faster and with higher quality."

#### 2. Gather data (7 mins)

* Have each team member write down things that are most important to "maximize their capabilities to deliver faster and with higher quality."
  * It’s important to encourage at least 2 items from each team member.
* Suggest some high level topics such as:
  * Time and location of Daily Scrum
  * Testing strategy (unit, functional, integration, performance, stress, etc…)
  * Build and infrastructure plans (shared responsibilities)
  * Team norms (be on time, respect estimates, help when needed, etc…)
  * How to address bugs/fires during Sprint
  * Product Manager availability (phone, office hours, attendance in Daily Scrum)
  * Expectations of each role and how they will work together at each phase of the SDLC

#### 3. Generate insights (15 mins)

* Discuss each item added by the team members and start grouping items which seem to relate to each other.
* If you want to limit the number of groups based on importance to keep focussed on the most important items, you can then use voting to determine priority.
  * This is optional because some teams have found value in this, while others have not.
  * Voting is also useful if there are a large number of conflicting views on how to do things.

#### 4. Decide what to do (15 mins)

* For each group, make sure that there are clear actions for each item where applicable.
* Retrospectives are a good time to have an action that changes an existing working agreement if we realise it’s an impediment to working better together.

#### 5. Close (5 mins)

* Make sure someone has taken ownership of documenting the Working Agreement and placing it near your Scrum Board or in your Wiki, Confluence Space or Google Docs.
* Gather feedback from the team on the usefulness/effectiveness of this format for future usage.
