# Taming notifications

We operate under the assumption that everyone in Artsy engineering has set up their notifications so that they won't be distrubed outside of working hours. This allows us to send messages, ask questions, make coments, etc. without fear of waking up someone in a different timezone.

This playbook collects some tips on setting up your notifications so that they respect your downtime.

## Slack

Slack allows you to configure your notification schedule very easily. In the Slack app, open `Preferences`, select `Notifications`, scroll down to `Notification Schedule`, and set your working hours. (I also *strongly* recommend that you select `Mute all sounds from Slack`, but that's up to you).

## Github

You can set different email addresses to be used for notifications from different Github organisations. Go to `Settings` > `Notifications` and scroll down to `Email notification preferences` and add your Artsy email address. Then scroll down to `Custom routing` and set your Artsy email address to be used for all notifications from the `artsy` organisation.

## Focus mode on iOS

Since iOS 15 you can use focus mode to turn off notifications from any apps at certain times of day. You can use this to hide all work-related notifications outside of working hours:

- Create "Work" and "Personal" (or similar) focus modes
- Set the notifications that you want to see in each of them
- Set "Work" to only be enabled during working hours

Even better, you can hide apps completely so that you're not tempted to check your work email in the middle of the night. The key to this is to create a separate home screen with all your work apps (I have Gmail, Slack, Notion, Google Calendar, plus widgets for Google Calendar and Things, my todo app of choice). You can then set this home screen to be hidden in all non-"Work" focus modes.
