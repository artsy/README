# Responding to an incident

## Step 1: Monitor

Incidents can be raised by automated or manual means. While on-call, you are responsible for being available to
respond to these issues.

- Monitor the [#incidents slack channel](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/C9RK0BLEP/) üîí for critical issues. This
  is where urgent issues are raised, either manually or via automated alerts.
- Monitor the [#alerts](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/C0HP61PUJ/) slack channel _during business/waking hours_.
  These automated system alerts _may_ be the first sign of a problem but don't _necessarily_ warrant treatment as
  immediate incidents. E.g., load-balancers may route around failing EC2 instances or auto-scaling may bring up
  capacity in response to load.
- Monitor and acknowledge automated uptime alerts created by OpsGenie.

  - For high-criticality systems, OpsGenie will open alerts if
    [Pingdom](https://my.pingdom.com/app/newchecks/checks) uptime checks are failing. Alerts will automatically
    close if resolved via Pingdom.
  - All engineers should have the OpsGenie app for
    [iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opsgenie/id528590328?mt=8) or
    [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifountain.opsgenie&hl=en) installed and be logged
    in.
  - Double check your preferences for push notifications, text messages, and/or phone calls for alerting in your
    [OpsGenie user notification settings](https://artsy.app.opsgenie.com/settings/user/notification).

## Step 2: Raise

1. When an incident is raised in the channel or identified in another way, the on-call team first **tracks the
   incident** by creating an incident in [OpsGenie](https://artsy.app.opsgenie.com/incident/list), based on the
   information they know at that time. Some workflow steps:

   - Select Artsy as the Impacted Service.
   - Enter a quick description of the problem as the Incident message.
   - Enter a link to the #incidents thread as the Incident description.
   - Select a Priority level from the list using your gut instinct. Refer to the
     [section on Severity of Incidents for guidance](#severity-of-incidents).
   - Take your best guess at the other information, it can always be edited later.

2. Create a Slack channel for this incident for discussion of the technical resolution.

   - Name it #incident-N, where N is the incident number from OpsGenie.
   - Invite the other on-call engineer and any other active responders to the new channel.
   - Add a link to the OpsGenie incident as the Purpose

3. In the original slack thread in #incidents, put a link to the new #incident-N channel and _direct engineers to
   continue communication in that channel_.

4. Update the [Artsy status page](status.artsy.net) by logging into the
   [Artsy StatusPage.io](https://manage.statuspage.io/pages/hmhlbjlmdhgh/incidents) account (creds in 1Password).

   Any incident with public impact should be communicated externally via the status page.

   - Communication does not have to be detailed. Not every stage of the incident needs to be communicated on status
     page.
   - Remember that this page is targeted to a public audience (i.e., users and partners) of Artsy products. Some
     might be subscribed to receive updates on every communication here.
   - The most important thing is acknowledging the issue, specifying the services affected and communicating key
     updates and resolutions.

## Step 3: Assess

1. Assign an Incident Commander to the incident. This person is the main point-person for facilitating an incident
   response. The Incident Commander could be yourself, another on-call engineer, or a Subject Matter Expert. See
   the [OpsGenie docs](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/incident-response-roles) for more details about incident
   roles.

2. Determine and update the severity of the incident by trying to reproduce the problem and following up with
   stakeholders as-needed. It may be helpful to find answers to the following:

   - How many people (or partners, etc.) does this affect?
   - Have you been able to reproduce?
   - Is this a new problem or something that we are aware of?

3. If the reported incident does not qualify for an immediate response:
   - Take the time to educate the reporter on the desired process (see the [examples](#examples) below). You may
     point them to the
     [Guide to Reporting Bugs](https://www.notion.so/artsy/Guide-to-reporting-bugs-cc25e1ff41194228b476c4963c646817)
     doc in Notion which describes this in a general way.
   - Direct stakeholders in the slack thread to a product team‚Äôs channel to ensure that a Jira Issue is tracked for
     this possible issue
   - Link the OpsGenie incident to any relevant bugs that are tracked (and create an additional one if necessary)
   - Mark the incident as **CLOSED**

## Step 4: Address Incident

**Investigate --> Identify --> Escalate --> Fix**

Discuss the incident's resolution in the dedicated Slack channel.

- Start a video conference with Zoom to communicate in real-time with other responders. Credentials to a shared
  Engineering Zoom Pro account are in 1Password.
- Fix if possible using [accumulated playbooks (wiki)](https://github.com/artsy/potential/wiki) üîí.
- If unable to fix using shared resources, contact the relevant [point-person](#point-people) for help and pair
  with them on a fix. Be sure to contribute lessons back to shared documentation. **You are not expected to know
  the ins and outs of every system, so don't hesitate to involve the wider team.**
- Share any applicable work-arounds or talking points in the thread to unblock teammates or partners.
- If you make an immediate fix but addressing the root cause requires further work, add the issue to the bug
  backlog so it can be prioritized accordingly.

**Note:** You are **not** responsible for fixing all of the bugs that you find. Most problems that require a coding
change should be addressed by the relevant team.

### Communicate

One of the on-call members handles internal and external communication for the incident. Assign this person to the
Communications Officer role in OpsGenie.

- #incidents is for non-on-call people to raise possible incidents or follow up (questions, etc.) about existing
  threads.
- Resolution happens exclusively in the dedicated slack channel associated with the OpsGenie incident.
- Communicate progress and major milestones publicly through statuspage.io. Updates don't need to be specific, but
  it is important that we give customers confidence that we are dealing with the incident.

#### Updating the Timeline

The Communications Officer should keep track of meaningful updates, discoveries, or milestones (e.g. changes in
availability or resolution) in the OpsGenie timeline.

Don't be afraid to over-communicate. The timeline is only available from within OpsGenie, so there is no risk of
alerting external stakeholders. In general, you should post to the timeline as any progress is made on the
incident, and much more frequently than you post to the StatusPage.

Keep in mind that the timeline will be referenced later while reviewing the incident. It's important to have as
much information captured as possible for piecing together the steps to resolution. If you forget to add an entry
in the moment, no worries! OpsGenie allows you to add entries after-the-fact with the correct timestamp.

For an example of a comprehensive timeline, check out
[this postmortem report](https://artsy.app.opsgenie.com/reports/post-mortem/b5710803-4bcb-4f0b-a906-4a2343521328/detail)üîí
from 10/29/19.

## Step 5: Resolve

Incidents are resolved when the immediate issue has been mitigated. After that, the team needs to make sure all
follow-up items are tracked and the OpsGenie incident clearly reflects this state.

1. Create any necessary follow-up tickets either in the bug backlog or a specific team‚Äôs project board. Link these
   from within the OpsGenie incident.
2. Post any final updates to the OpsGenie incident

   - Add a timeline entry describing why you're resolving the incident
   - Mark the incident as **RESOLVED**

3. Resolve any outstanding incidents on our status page via statuspage.io.
4. Create a post mortem in OpsGenie.
5. Update relevant [playbooks](https://github.com/artsy/potential/wiki) üîí with any lessons.

## Severity of Incidents

### P1 - **Critical**

Critical incidents have a very high impact:

- A user-facing service is down for all users.
- Confidentiality or privacy is breached.
- Customer data loss.
- ‚ÄúAll hands on deck.‚Äù

#### Examples

- Artsy website is down.
- Artsy website is under DDoS attack.

### P2 - **High**

High incidents have a significant impact:

- A user-facing service is down for a subset of users.
- Core functionality is impacted for a specific use-case.
- Need to find the best people to solve as soon as possible.

#### Examples

- Partners unable to delete artworks in CMS
- Multiple partners unable to add credit cards
- Artwork pages showing duplicate information

### P3 - **Moderate**

Moderate incidents have a low impact but require some urgency:

- A user-facing service is down for a single user.
- Core functionality is impacted for a single resource.
- Should inform the relevant product team about the issue.

#### Examples

- Broken links in Eigen on UNTITLED art fair page
- A single partner cannot access CMS
- User unable to place bid on lot in live sale, needs to be placed in the backend

### P4 - **Low**

Low incidents have low impact and low urgency:

- Known issues that are on a product team‚Äôs radar.
- Issues that can be handled in a regular sprint‚Äôs work.

#### Examples

- Charge details for a partner need updating.
- Artwork appearance on the site (‚Äúhow come it‚Äôs not showing up in‚Ä¶‚Äù).

### P5 - **Informational**

Informational incidents have no customer impact. They are often created for reporting or training purposes.
