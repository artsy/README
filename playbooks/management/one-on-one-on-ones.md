title: One on One on Ones
description: Transitioning to a new Engineering Manager
---

Within Artsy engineering, we prioritize the persistence of reporting lines in order to foster a deeper relationship
between manager and report. This is in fact one of the primary motivations for the matrix structure that we use:
keeping the report/manager relationship orthogonal to team membership means that it can survive independent of any
movement between teams, or major team reorganizations. In spite of this, it is sometimes necessary for an
individual to transition to a new manager.

Such transitions are fraught with potential problems for the individual: they might spend weeks -- or even months
-- building up a rapport to the same degree that they had with their previous manager; they might not know what
information about their goals and achievements had been communicated from the old manager to the new one, and
whether that information even matches their _own_ view of those goals and achievements.

Given these potential problems, we have found that one on one on ones are the best tool to facilitate a smooth
change.

## The Theory

A one on one on one is a meeting between the individual, the old manager and the new manager. The main purpose of
the meeting is for the old manager to handoff the individual to the new manager by going over:

- the latest performance review feedback
- any more recent feedback and information
- the individual's goals and main growth areas

Transferring this information in the presence of the individual can be awkward -- who likes being discussed while
they listen? and conversely, who likes discussing someone in their presence? -- but it has (at least) two benefits:
it allows the individual to know _exactly_ what information is being transferred from the old manager to the new
one, and it also gives them an opportunity to challenge or alter that information if they find that their old
manager's perspective differs from their own.

It is vital that this meeting is the only time information transfer between the managers takes place, and that
there are no further back-room discussions. Trust is the basis for any sound relationship, and much of the initial
period of the relationship between manager and report is taken up with building that trust. This takes time and
clearly cannot be done in a single meeting, but the total transparency of this style of handover ensures that the
individual has trust in the formative process of the new relationship, thereby setting the rest of it off on a good
footing.

## The Practice

Since this is a slightly unusual format, we have found that it's important to provide as much structure as
possible. The process should be instigated by one of the managers -- preferably the new one -- sending an email to
the individual and the other manager to invite them to the one on one on one, and to explain its purpose. Here's an
example of this email (inspired -- along with other parts of this playbook -- by
[this excellent blogpost](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-handoffs/))

> I'd like to hijack your scheduled 1:1 next week to do a "manager handoff", with the two of you. If it's OK with
> both of you, we could extend this "1:1:1" to be up to 60 minutes long, as needed.
>
> Here's the plan:
>
> 1. [Old Manager] will cover:
>
> - Most recent review cycle feedback
> - More recent feedback, projects, and other info since the last review cycle
> - [Individual]'s goals, growth areas, things I should know
>
> 2. [Individual], this will also be an opportunity for you to agree/disagree with how these things are
>    described/characterized, and also an opportunity for you to have a complete picture of the info shared between
>    <Old Manager> and me. The goal is to make sure we're transparent in the handoff of your career, how you want
>    to grow, and the best ways I can support you.
>
> This stuff can naturally be very awkward for all involved :) This is okay (and normal!). The payoff for this
> awkwardness is clarity, a smooth transition, and enabling me to fully support [Individual]'s career path.
>
> I hope that you're both happy and comfortable with this arrangement. If not, or if you're unsure about anything,
> feel free to let me know your questions, doubts or complaints!

When the time for the meeting comes, the new manager -- who should act as master of ceremonies -- should
recapitulate the steps and aims outlined in the email, and ensure that the individual understands that they are
free to interrupt and disagree at any point. It's also probably worth mentioning again that the whole process is
potentially awkward for everyone involved. The new manager should then provide all the relevant information,
pausing and inviting comment every step of the way.

More often than not, there is little or no divergence between the old manager's and the individual's view of
things, and the meeting ends up being considerably shorter than an hour. But even if things do get uncomfortable or
even heated, it's important to remember that this, too, is productive for everyone involved.

Once this process has been completed, the individual and their new manager should be set up for success in their
new relationship, and it should be possible for the individual to continue with minimal disturbance in their
journey towards whatever career goals they, with or without the guidance of their manager, have set for themselves.
